# VRCImmersiveImmobilize

Workaround for the remote IK jitter issue and allows entering objects/walls in VRChat when using full body tracking. <br>

This functions similarly to [SouljaVR/AutoImmobilizeOSC](https://github.com/SouljaVR/AutoImmobilizeOSC) while not using the controllers touch capacitors to trigger immobilization, but rather the state of movement on the stick. Hence fixing the problem while trying to make the user feel like its not even there. <br>

Please upvote this [Canny by SouljaVR](https://feedback.vrchat.com/vrchat-ik-20/p/network-jitter-with-ik) to get this problem fixed on VRChats end.
